# Coursera Assignment
 Practical Machine Learning for Coursera

 This repository contains both the Rmd file as well as the html file as per the requirements. You can check the code for the Rmd, but because I have not included the input data or the workspace image, the code WILL NOT RUN.
 However, the assignment mentions that the code is not to be run.

 Thank you.
